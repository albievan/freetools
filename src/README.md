# Free Golang Utilities

This repository contains source code for five useful tools developed in Golang:
* Simple HTTP Server,
* Dynamic DNS Updater for GoDaddy,
* Mouse Wiggler Tool,
* Folder Monitor Utility, and
* Version Tool.

Each of these tools is designed to simplify common tasks and enhance your productivity. The code is open-source and free to use or modify. However, as the creator of these tools, I provide no warranties and cannot guarantee the code's behavior in your particular environment. Please use them at your own risk.

## Third-Party Packages

These utilities incorporate several third-party packages. Similar to my own code, I cannot offer any warranty or guarantee for these packages. You should review any third-party packages yourself to ensure they meet your requirements and are suitable for your purposes.

## Contribute

Though the code is offered without warranty, it is a product of careful work and sincere effort. If you find these tools useful and decide to download or use the source code, I'd appreciate if you could leave a short positive message. This is not required, but it serves as a great motivation for me to continue producing and sharing free tools like these.

Remember, this code is yours to use and modify as you see fit. You're welcome to contribute improvements or variations back to this repository if you wish.

Happy coding!
